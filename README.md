Xylophone App


Created in Android Studio 3.2.1, run on Nexus 4 Android Emulator

This is a simple xylophone app. It produces different sounds when the user clicks the colourful icon.

The xylophone is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars struck by mallets. Each bar is an idiophone tuned to a pitch of a musical scale, whether pentatonic or heptatonic in the case of many African and Asian instruments, diatonic in many western children's instruments, or chromatic for orchestral use.
